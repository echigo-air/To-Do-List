# 📝 C++ To-Do List (CLI)

A lightweight command-line To-Do List application written in C++.  
Built as a learning project to strengthen core C++ fundamentals through a real, usable program.

Simple by design. Practical by purpose.

## 🧠 How It Works

- Tasks are stored in memory using a `vector`
- Each task consists of:
  - Task description
  - Completion status
- All tasks are automatically saved and loaded from a local file
- The application runs entirely in the terminal (CLI-based)

## 🎯 Learning Focus

This project was created to practice:

- `struct` and `vector`
- File input/output
- Loop and menu-driven program flow
- User input handling
- Basic data persistence
- Clean CLI UX logic

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project is intended for learning purposes.  
It prioritizes clarity and understanding over advanced optimizations or complex abstractions.

## ⭐ Why This Project Exists

If you're learning C++ and want:
- A real project instead of toy examples
- Something you can extend later
- A clean base for CLI applications

This is a solid starting point.

If you find this useful, feel free to ⭐ the repo and build on top of it.
